## Key Assumptions for Linear Regression

When performing linear regression, several key assumptions must be met to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model. These assumptions are crucial for the validity of the results and the interpretability of the model. Below are the primary assumptions:

- **Continuity**: All variables involved in the linear regression should be continuous and numerical. Categorical variables are not suitable for linear regression without proper transformation or encoding.

- **No Missing Values**: The dataset should be free from missing values and outliers. Missing data can lead to biased estimates, and outliers can disproportionately influence the model's results.

- **Linear Relationship**: There must be a linear relationship between the predictors (independent variables) and the predictant (dependent variable). This assumption ensures that the linear model is appropriate for the data.

- **Independence**: All predictors should be independent of one another. Multicollinearity, where predictors are highly correlated, can distort the results and make it difficult to determine the effect of each predictor.

- **Normal Distribution of Residuals**: The residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values, should be normally distributed. This assumption allows for valid statistical inference and confidence intervals.

Meeting these assumptions is essential for the linear regression model to provide meaningful insights and predictions. Violations of these assumptions can lead to inaccurate conclusions and unreliable predictions.
